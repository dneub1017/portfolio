                I am a Baton Rouge native.  I attended Broadmoor HS and later LSU.  I have been involved in athletics almost my entire life.  I began playing football in 5th grade and have played or coached every season since.  My favorite subject in school was always math.  I have also always been into computers and technology.  I wanted to learn to code so I took a class through codehs.com, which got also me started teaching computer science.  I am now currently taking a web development course through Udemy.com to further my education in coding.  Web Design has become my favorite aspect of coding.  When I was in high school I would help out at my family's printing business doing typsetting (business cards, letterheads, flyers, etc. ) and Web Design is the modern technical version of that.

                I got my first teaching job right out of school at False River Academy in New Roads.  After a year I left for St. Michael High School in Baton Rouge which was a much shorter commute.  At St. Michael I taught Algebra 1 and/or Geometry.  I was at St. Michael for 9 years.  During that time I was also on the search committe when we decided to go 1:1 with technology for the student body.  This was a great learning experience and it also introduced me to a new way of doing things in my classroom.  At St. Michael I also coached football and track & field.

                After 9 years at St. Michael I left for University Lab School.  This was a great opportunity for me and my family.  At U-High I began by teaching just Algebra 1 and/or Geometry.  As I started to learn some basic coding skills I wanted to teach computer science so I begged for the opportunity.  I am currently in my third year teaching computer science.  After the first year the course changed to AP Computer Science Principles.  This course is meant to be somewhat of a introduction into the subject so students learn a variety things.  The first semester is spent mostly coding HTML, CSS, and Javacript.  The second semester is more how things work.

                I have been married for almost 16 years.  Our family situation is somewhat complicated.  We are a foster family so children are always coming and going from our home.  We have two biological children and currently have 1 foster child.  We live on family land in St. Gabriel.  Family is very important to me, which is part of the reason for the possible career change.  Coaching/Teaching is a very demanding job.  It is a 24/7 job and is taking its toll on my family.  There are lots of late nights and my wife being a "single mom".  The job also takes its toll physically.  I am looking for a career change for a these reasons, and just a new challenge.  I have been teaching/coaching for 16 years and the idea of getting into the tech field is very exciting to me.
